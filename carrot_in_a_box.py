  Carrot in a Box,
  This is a bluffing game for two human players. Each player has a box.
  One box has a carrot in it. To win, you must have the box with the
  carrot in it.
 
  This is a very simple and silly game.
 
  The first player looks into their box (the second player must close
  their eyes during this). The first player then says "There is a carrot
  in my box" or "There is not a carrot in my box". The second player then
  gets to decide if they want to swap boxes or not.
